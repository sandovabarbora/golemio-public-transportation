# Technical Implementation Documentation
## Public Transport Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

The Public Transport Analysis Dashboard is built using Python and Streamlit framework for creating data applications. The application provides real-time analysis of transport delays and their correlation with sporting events through an intuitive web interface.

## Application Architecture

### Main Application Structure

The dashboard is organized using a modular architecture:
- Core Analysis Engine
- Data Processing Pipeline
- Interactive Frontend
- Cache Management System

Each component is designed as a separate module, allowing for independent development and maintenance. The main application file (app.py) serves as an orchestrator, managing data flow and component rendering.

### Resource Management

The application features a sophisticated resource management system:
- Memory-optimized data structures
- Efficient caching mechanisms
- Resource cleanup protocols
- Load balancing capabilities

## Data Management

### Data Loading Strategy

We implement a sophisticated data loading system that balances performance with memory constraints:

- Chunked data loading for large datasets
- Incremental processing pipeline
- Memory-aware caching system
- Garbage collection optimization

### State Management

The application maintains state using a combination of:
- Local file system caching
- Memory-mapped files
- Temporary storage management
- Session state persistence

## Interactive Components

### Map Visualization

The map component utilizes Folium for interactive geographic visualization:

1. Memory-Efficient Marker Mode:
   - Dynamic marker loading
   - Clustered visualization
   - On-demand data fetching
   - Resource-aware rendering

2. Optimized Heatmap Mode:
   - Chunked data processing
   - Progressive rendering
   - Memory-conscious updates
   - Efficient data binning

### Statistical Visualizations

We use Altair with performance optimizations:
- Incremental chart updates
- Data sampling for large datasets
- Memory-efficient rendering
- Resource-aware interactivity
