# Streamlit Technical Documentation
## Public Transport Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

The Public Transport Analysis Dashboard is built using Streamlit, a Python framework for creating data applications. The application provides real-time analysis of transport delays and their correlation with sporting events through an intuitive web interface.

## Application Architecture

### Main Application Structure

The dashboard is organized using Streamlit's tab-based layout system, which divides the application into three main sections:
- Delay Statistics
- Event Analysis
- Delay Predictions

Each tab is designed as a separate component, allowing for modular development and maintenance. The main application file (app.py) serves as an orchestrator, managing data flow and tab rendering.

### Sidebar Implementation

The application features a persistent sidebar that houses all control elements and data management functions. This design choice ensures that users have consistent access to important functions while maintaining a clean main display area. The sidebar includes:
- Data update controls
- File upload functionality
- Filtering options
- Time period selectors

## Data Management

### Data Loading Strategy

We implement a sophisticated data loading system that balances performance with real-time data needs. The system uses Streamlit's caching mechanisms to optimize data retrieval while ensuring data freshness. Key features include:

- Cached data loading for frequently accessed datasets
- Incremental updates for real-time information
- Automatic cache invalidation based on time-to-live (TTL)
- Session state management for user-specific data

### State Management

The application maintains state using Streamlit's session state feature. This allows us to:
- Persist user selections across interactions
- Maintain uploaded data between page refreshes
- Store computation results for reuse
- Manage user preferences and settings

## Interactive Components

### Map Visualization

The map component utilizes Folium integration with Streamlit to provide interactive geographic visualization of transport delays. Users can choose between two visualization modes:

1. Marker Mode:
   - Individual stops shown as markers
   - Color-coded by delay severity
   - Interactive tooltips with detailed information

2. Heatmap Mode:
   - Density-based visualization of delays
   - Dynamic color scaling
   - Real-time updates based on filtered data

### Statistical Visualizations

We use Altair for creating interactive statistical visualizations. These charts are designed to:
- Respond to user interactions
- Update dynamically with data changes
- Provide detailed tooltips
- Support zoom and pan operations

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

Our caching strategy is built around three main principles:

1. Data Caching:
   - Heavy computations are cached
   - Data loading operations use TTL-based caching
   - Cache invalidation on data updates

2. Resource Caching:
   - Static resources are persistently cached
   - Computational models are cached between sessions
   - Visualization templates are cached for reuse

3. Dynamic Updates:
   - Selective cache clearing
   - Incremental data updates
   - Smart recomputation of affected components

### Memory Management

The application implements several memory optimization techniques:

- Lazy loading of large datasets
- Data filtering at source
- Efficient data structure usage
- Regular garbage collection

## Layout System

### Responsive Design

The dashboard employs a responsive layout system that:
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Maintains readability on mobile devices
- Provides consistent user experience across platforms
- Handles dynamic content resizing

### Component Organization

Components are organized following a hierarchy that prioritizes:
- Logical grouping of related elements
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Intuitive navigation
- Consistent spacing and alignment

## Data Visualization Strategy

### Chart Selection

Our visualization strategy is based on data type and user needs:
- Time series data: Line charts with interactive elements
- Categorical comparisons: Bar charts with grouping options
- Geographic data: Interactive maps with multiple layers
- Statistical distributions: Box plots and histograms

### Interactive Features

All visualizations include interactive features that enhance user understanding:
- Hover tooltips with detailed information
- Click interactions for detailed views
- Zoom and pan capabilities
- Dynamic filtering

## Error Handling

The application implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation
- Data validation
- Recovery mechanisms

## Configuration Management

### Runtime Configuration

The application uses a flexible configuration system that manages:
- Page settings
- Layout preferences
- Chart defaults
- Data update frequencies

### User Preferences

User preferences are managed through:
- Session state storage
- Persistent settings
- Custom defaults
- User-specific configurations

## Future Considerations

The technical architecture supports future enhancements including:
- Additional data sources
- New visualization types
- Enhanced prediction models
- Extended analysis capabilities

## Conclusion

This technical implementation leverages Streamlit's strengths while adding custom functionality for transport data analysis. The modular design ensures maintainability and extensibility, while performance optimizations provide a smooth user experience.
